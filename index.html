      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Run the tap to allow the water to aerate and only boil the kettle once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in the water helps with flavour!
        </li>
        <li>
          Put tea bag into your mug (<em>always</em> a big mug).
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the hot water into the mug and stir.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tea needs time to unlock its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to brew. This is the perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it against the mug with a spoon. Not too much or you'll make it go bitter.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to, go ahead and add some milk and/or sugar/honey.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enjoy!
      </ol>
